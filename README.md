# Elevator-System
## About Project
in This project we are impelement an elevator that response to request in best time and least change direction and imeplemntation in 2 way , first is static and another one is dynamic mode 
## algorithm
In our algorithm , first calculate a factor by the difference of distance ( request floor and current floor ) and difference of reuqest time , then sort in priority queue and response to the requests dynamically
